I'm an unlikely data scientist. I'm not a very 'techy' person. I love the physical Sunday paper and miss maps you can draw on with a marker. Every few months I get the urge to switch back to a flip phone. I'm not the person you would have ever asked to help you set up a DVD player (back when those existed).  

In college, I dropped the econ minor I had been flirting with because I found statistics fantastically dull and tedious. It lacked the invigoration of problem-solving that I had loved in my high school math courses. I also resented the required (and poorly designed) *Frontiers of Science* course that took time away from my exploration of literature, philosophy, and art. I turned to the liberal arts to help me answer questions about the human condition - why we come to believe what we believe, how we build and revise our individual and national identities, what a just society might look like, etc. 

Eventually, those same questions led me to study public policy in graduate school, where I soon found myself dreading the required statistics course. Maybe it was the instructor or maybe it was the application to real world concepts, but this time I fell head-over-heels for the elegant brilliance of statistical inference. (My friends quickly grew sick of hearing me wax on about Fisher's exact test or quasi-experimental methodologies.)

That course brought with it my introduction to coding as I learned to use Stata, a data analysis software common in academia. It was so cool to get first-hand experience manipulating data through this new language I was learning and running the statistical tests that fascinated me. As much as I love the problem-solving aspect of writing code, at the beginning there were times I wanted to go full out *Office Space* in the windowless computer lab as I wielded commands I harldy understood in syntax I could barely decode. Of course, that fades over time with a little determination and a lot of grit.

Now that I've started the Data Science Bootcamp at Metis, I may be an unlikely data scientist, but I'm definitely an enthusiastic one. I'm thrilled to be learning and applying these techniques I'm fascinated by that will hopefully help me continue to ask and answer questions about the world. And still, learning python has been tough and frustrating (and rewarding too!), not unlike learning Stata years ago. But hey, on the bright side, I haven't thrown my computer against the wall yet. ðŸ˜¬
